In this assignment, for part A, I've used a screenshot of the code as a heightmap, applied it to a plane mesh, and animated it. I've also setup a cubemap around the world, and made the water walls, which are parts from the plane mesh, reflect the cubemap. However, there's no fresnel effect implemented.

For part B, I've implemented an explosion from particles, by simply setting the spawn rate to 0. I've also tried to create realistic ocean waves, using the Perlin noise and sine function. However, the end result looks ridiculous, because I don't know how a real wave works.
